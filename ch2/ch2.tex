%Modeling the movement of information within social media outlets, like
%Twitter, is key to understanding to how ideas spread but quantifying such
%movement runs into several difficulties. Two specific areas that elude a clear
%characterization are (i) the intrinsic random nature of individuals to
%potentially adopt and subsequently broadcast a Twitter topic, and (ii) the
%dissemination of information via non-Twitter sources, such as news outlets
%and word of mouth, and its impact on Twitter propagation. These distinct
%yet inter-connected areas must be incorporated to generate a
%comprehensive model of information diffusion. We propose a bispace model
%to capture propagation in the union of (exclusively) Twitter and
%non-Twitter environments. To quantify the stochastic nature of Twitter
%topic propagation, we combine principles of geometric Brownian motion and
%traditional network graph theory. We apply Poisson process functions to model
%information diffusion outside of the Twitter mentions network. We discuss techniques
%to unify the two sub-models to accurately model information dissemination. We
%demonstrate the novel application of these techniques on real
%Twitter datasets related to mass protest adoption in social communities.
