(ABSTRACT)

\end{center}

Online social networks have become a staging ground for modern movements, with the Arab
Spring being the most prominent example. In an effort to understand and predict those movements, social media is regarded as valuable social sensor to disclose the underlying behavior and pattern. To fully understand the mass movement information propagation pattern in social networks, several problems need to be considered and addressed. Specifically, modeling mass movements that incorporate (i) multiple spaces (ii) dynamic network structure (iii) misinformation and (iv) swift outbreak/slowly evolving transmission would be highly propitious in understanding information propagation in social media.

This dissertation explores four research problems underlying mass movement adoption in social media. First, how do mass movements get mobilized on Twitter, especially in a specific geographic area. Second, how do we detect protest activity in social networks by observing group anomaly in graph?
Third, how do we distinguish real movements from rumors or misinformation campaigns? Fourth, how can we infer the indicators of a specific type of protest, say climate related protest?

A fundamental objective of this research has been to comprehensively study the mass movement adoption in social networks, it may cross multiple spaces, it may evolve with dynamic network structures, it can be swift outbreaks or long term slowly evolving transmissions, what is more, it may mixed with misinformation campaigns. Each of those issues requires the development of new mathematical models and algorithmic approaches which are explored here.  It is my hope that this work will facilitate advancements in information propagation, group anomaly detection and misinformation distinction, and ultimately helps improve the understanding of mass movement and their adoptions in social networks.

%As social media (e.g., Twitter) continues to increase in popularity, it is becoming employed
%as a social sensor into real-world events. Most current research focuses on
%{\it massive} information transmission patterns that might correlate to world events.
%In this proposed work, we focus on four less-studied problems in information
%diffusion over social media. In contrast to popular memes, they constitute
%{\it rare}, {\it localized}, {\it absent}, and/or {\it slowly evolving} transmission paterns.
%(i) First, how does misinformation spread, i.e.,
%rumors, innuendo, and falsehoods? (ii) Second, how do mass movements get mobilized
%on Twitter, especially in a specific geographic area, (iii) Third, how do we detect
%absenteeism in social network activity and how can this information be employed?
%and (iv) Fourth, how do social
%networks enable the study of long-running, slowly evolving, societal phenomena (e.g., awareness
%of climate change)?
%Each of these issues requires the development of new mathematical models and algorithmic
%approaches which are explored here. Applications are drawn from the worlds of politics,
%civil unrest, and natural disasters.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Over the past four and half years I have received support and encouragement from a great number of individuals.

My deepest gratitude is to my advisor, Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan. I have been amazingly fortunate to have an advisor who gave me the freedom to explore on my own, and at the same time pick me back when I got lost. His far-sighted research attitude and respectable personality lead Discovery Analytics Center a collaborative and productive place. His insight, wisdom and humour make my graduate study a rich and rewarding journey, which I will cherish forever.

I am grateful to Dr. Chang-Tien Lu, one of the best teachers that I have had in my life. He introduced data analytics and open a new window to me. He provided infinite support and encouragement while I was looking for an academic job.

I would like to thank Dr. Feng Chen, a mentor and a friend, for his support over the past several years as I moved from an idea to a completed study. I am deeply grateful to him for the countless discussions that helped me sort out the technical details of my paper.

I appreciate the efforts of Dr. Yang Cao, for his encouragement and practical advice in inspiring me to work on chapter~\ref{ch:rumor}. I am also thankful to him sparing no effort in supporting my job hunting and I deeply appreciate his belief in me.

I would like to say thanks to Dr. Chris North, for his support, feedback, and valuable discussions that helped me understand my research area better. It has always been pleasant to have such a knowledgeable and amiable professor around.

I would like to thank Dr. Huzefa Rangwala, who is always generous to give advice and provide help. I hope one day I would become a good advisor as Dr. Rangwala has been to me.

I am also indebted to the members of Discovery Analytics Center, thanks for making our lab such a warm and joyful family.

I would like to thank my collaborator Edward Dougherty, one of the best collaborators ever. His enthusiasm and efficiency has always inspired me.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my parents for their constant source of strength. I am so grateful to my husband for his care, sacrifice, and love. I would like to say thanks to him for walking with me through hardship, challenge and setbacks.
