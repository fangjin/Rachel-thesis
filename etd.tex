(ABSTRACT)

\end{center}

Online social networks have become a staging ground for modern movements, with the Arab
Spring being the most prominent example. In an effort to understand and predict those movements, social media is regarded as valuable social sensor to disclose the underlying behavior and pattern. To fully understand the mass movement information propagation pattern in social networks, several problems need to be considered and addressed. Specifically, modeling mass movements that incorporate (i) multiple spaces (ii) dynamic network structure (iii) swift outbreak/slowly evolving transmission (iv) misinformation would be highly propitious in understanding information propagation in social medias.

This dissertation explores four research problems underlying mass movement adoption in social media. First, how do mass movements get mobilized on Twitter, especially in a specific geographic area. Second, how do we detect protest activity in social networks by observing group abnormality in graph? Third, how can we infer the causality of a specific type of protest, say climate related protest? Fourth, how do we distinguish real movements from rumors or misinformation campaigns?

A fundamental objective of this research has been to comprehensively study the mass movement adoption in social networks, it may cross multiple spaces, it may evolve with dynamic network structures, it can be swift outbreaks or long term slowly evolving transmissions, what is more, it may mixed with misinformation campaigns. Each of those issues requires the development of new mathematical models and algorithmic approaches which are explored here.  It is my hope that this work will facilitate advancements in information propagation, group abnormality detection and misinformation distinction, and ultimately helps improve the understanding of mass movement and their adoptions in social networks.

%As social media (e.g., Twitter) continues to increase in popularity, it is becoming employed
%as a social sensor into real-world events. Most current research focuses on
%{\it massive} information transmission patterns that might correlate to world events.
%In this proposed work, we focus on four less-studied problems in information
%diffusion over social media. In contrast to popular memes, they constitute
%{\it rare}, {\it localized}, {\it absent}, and/or {\it slowly evolving} transmission paterns.
%(i) First, how does misinformation spread, i.e.,
%rumors, innuendo, and falsehoods? (ii) Second, how do mass movements get mobilized
%on Twitter, especially in a specific geographic area, (iii) Third, how do we detect
%absenteeism in social network activity and how can this information be employed?
%and (iv) Fourth, how do social
%networks enable the study of long-running, slowly evolving, societal phenomena (e.g., awareness
%of climate change)?
%Each of these issues requires the development of new mathematical models and algorithmic
%approaches which are explored here. Applications are drawn from the worlds of politics,
%civil unrest, and natural disasters.
