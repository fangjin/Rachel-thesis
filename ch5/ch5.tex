%\begin{abstract}
%Characterizing information diffusion on social platforms like Twitter
%enables us to understand the properties of underlying media
%and model communication patterns. As Twitter gains
%in popularity, it has also become a venue to broadcast rumors and
%misinformation. We use epidemiological models to characterize
%information cascades in twitter resulting from both news and rumors.
%Specifically, we use the SEIZ enhanced epidemic
%model that explicitly recognizes skeptics to
%characterize eight events across the world and spanning
%a range of event types.
%We demonstrate that our approach is accurate at capturing diffusion in these
%events. Our approach can be
%fruitfully combined with other strategies that use content modeling
%and graph theoretic features to detect (and possibly disrupt) rumors.
